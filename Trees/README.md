# Trees

## Binary Trees
These are trees with up to two children.  No more.

Binary Search Tree is when all left descendents <= n < all right descendents.

## Ternary Trees
These are trees with up to more than two children.

## Terms

### Leaf
- A node with no children.

### Complete Binary Tree
- Every level of the three is filled, except perhaps the last level.  If the last level is not filled, it should be filled left to right.

### Full Binary Tree
- Every node has either zero or two children.  No nodes have only one child.

### Perfect Binary Tree
- Both full and complete.  All leaf nodes wil be at the same level, and this level has the maximum number of nodes.
- These are very rare.  Requires 2^k - 1 nodes. (where k is number of levels).
